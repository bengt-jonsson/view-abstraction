We have presented a uniform framework for automatically verifying
linearizability of  singly-linked list-based concurrent implementations of
sets, stacks, and queues, annotated with linearization policies.
Our contributions include a novel formalism for specifying
linearization policies with non-fixed LPs, an extension of thread-modular
reasoning, and an extension of existing symbolic representations
of unbounded singly-linked-list structures containing data from
an unbounded domain.
We have verified all linearizable singly-linked list-based implementations
known to us in the literature.

%% The systems we consider are infinite in multiple dimensions, namely,

we intend to extend the framework to more
complex data structures.
