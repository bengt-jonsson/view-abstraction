\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
We have present a technique for automatic verification of concurrent
data structure algorithms that operate on different forms
of dynamically allocated heap structures such as singly-linked lists,
skiplists, and arrays of lists.
It is the first technique which can automatically verify concurrent
data structure algoritms that operate on dynamically allocated
heap structures which are more complex than just singly-linked lists, such as
skip lists and arrays of singly linked lists.
Our fragment abstraction represent heap states by a set of  fragments,
each of which describes how two node types (tags) can be connected by a
pointer-field. 
We have implemented our technique, and provided the first automated
verification of concurrent data structure algorithms
that operate on skiplists and arrays of lists with timestamps.

The success of our technique indicate that
tags appear to carry a suitable combination of local and
global information, that is particularly suitable for symmetric concurrent
algorithms, in which threads communicate via the heap and global variables.
In the future,
%% Since the shape abstraction  is orthogonal to the rest of the framework, 
we intend to extend the framework to other
complex data structures, such as trees.
