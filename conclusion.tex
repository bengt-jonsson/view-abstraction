We have presented a novel shape abstraction, called fragment abstraction,
for automatic verification of
concurrent data structure implementations that operate different forms of
dynamically allocated heap structures, including singly-linked lists, skiplists,
and arrays of singly-linked lists.
Our approach is the first framework that
can automatically verify concurrent data structure implementations that employ
skiplists and arrays of singly linked lists,
at the same time as handling an unbounded
number of concurrent threads, an unbounded domain of data values
(including timestamps), and an unbounded shared heap.
We showed fragment abstraction allows to combine local and global reachability
information to allow verification of the functional behavior
of a collection of threads.

As future work, we intend to investigate whether fragment abstraction can be
applied also to other heap structures, such as concurrent binary search trees.
